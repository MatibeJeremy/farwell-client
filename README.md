# Step-by-Step Setup for the Application

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the Next.js application, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **Yarn or npm** (package manager)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Using Yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```
```
Modify the values based on your local setup.

## Step 4: Ensure Backend and Database Are Running
Before running the frontend, ensure the backend and database services are running:

## Step 5: Start the Next.js Application
Once the backend and database are running, start the Next.js development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Or with Yarn:
```sh
yarn dev
```
The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 6: Verify Setup
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.
- Check the browser console for any errors.
- Ensure API calls are functioning correctly by inspecting the Network tab.

Following these steps ensures a smooth local development experience with Next.js.
